The Wiggins deal
Kings get: Andrew Wiggins

Timberwolves get: Iman Shumpert, Zach Randolph and Justin Jackson

Kevin Arnovitz: For the Timberwolves, this is an opportunity to act on their buyer's remorse and eradicate the four years and $122 million remaining on Wiggins' contract after this season. In exchange, the Wolves take on the expiring contracts of Shumpert and Randolph, and they get an inexpensive look at Jackson for a couple of seasons. In the process, Minnesota will free up minutes for rookie guard Josh Okogie, who needs some reps.

For Sacramento, the acquisition would be a bit of a chemistry experiment. But the Kings are flush with cap space moving forward and are an improbable destination for any max-level free agent. Wiggins might never live up to his potential and could be a drag on a team that plays with as much energy as any young team in the league. But perhaps a change of scenery would draw out more of his raw talent and give Sacramento a true creator on the wing, something lacking on a roster loaded with 4s and 5s.
