The Spurs embrace the tank
Spurs get: Dennis Smith Jr., Wesley Matthews and a 2021 second-round pick

Mavericks get: DeMar DeRozan

Andrew Han: Ever since the Spurs lost promising point guard Dejounte Murray in the preseason, they've been staving off their first lottery appearance since 1997. They're only three games apart in the loss column, but San Antonio and Dallas are trending in opposite directions. The Mavs are currently sixth in point differential (seventh in the standings), and the Spurs are 14th (10th in the standings). To jettison DeRozan and restart with Murray and dunking dynamo Dennis Smith Jr. would be the fifth stage of grief as San Antonio finally comes to terms with the end of its era of dominance.

Meanwhile, Dallas continues to make others look foolish for not swinging for Luka Doncic in the draft. The Slovenian product has harnessed the hype, and the Mavs are unexpectedly frisky for the playoffs. As a proven scorer, DeRozan can take some of the attention off the rookie and turn a "just happy to be here" playoff hopeful into a postseason rabble-rouser.
