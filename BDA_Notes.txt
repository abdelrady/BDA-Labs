Midterm review

1-MCQ, some cases more than one answer (about 10)
2-Short answer questions-> like give you a dataset and asks to classify for predicting the label for the sample computation
algorithm kind of questions- about 3 or 5 questions
3-very short answers  about 2 or 3

no calculator :/
you can bring a cheat sheet: you can write anything (nos el A4)  :)
read or know the output of specific code, but there won't be question for writing code (any code in lectures or demos)
anything marked as optional in the slides when it 


Lesson 0: propability, conditional propability
what is the meaninng of central tendency and variation and how to compute quartile range
Lesson 1: not in exam
Lesson 2: linear regression: what kind of info scatter plot tells us? form direction and strength
and correlation is the mathemical mesurement of strength (the closer the value to one the stronger the relationship is)
properties for correlation values
simple linear regression equation betas equation and the interpretation , how to estimate beta 0 and beta 1 slide 17
Then using R code (to be able to read it)
relationship between beta 1 hat and correlation r, slide 21

Lesson 3: same as 2 with multiple

Lesson4: Why use logistic regression?  the equation with betas , slide 12 equations
proofs of the equations, how we come up with this equation for P. 
interpretation
then maximum likelhood how to estimate beta 0 and beta 1 hat
pi is the predicted propability from the model , qi to measure how close the predicted result is to the real or actual event result

how good is the model, mcfadden sudo r suqare


Lesson 5: Type of data qualitative, quantitative to see what type of the data
see the code for summerizing the data and see the code, what it does and what it gives us
you need to be able to summerize data from generated plot

exam question: code and output plot from the code, then you say what information we get from the plot to summerize the data
example plot tells us the frequencies, the number of passengers who survived from titanic is about 600 slide 10

pie chart example: percentage of each passenger class 

Lesson 6: 
what is supervised and unsupervised and difference
two step process classification 
then bayes rule and using it for classification
slide 16 , propability x belong to c1 then to c2 ...etc then we give it a class with the highest propability

Iris example r code, what is the output from the code and how do we interpret that output
Weka is not in the exam

Lesson 7: other measures for atribyte slection slide 24  and overfitting and tree pruning is not in exam 
pseudo code for tree we won't write this code but we can explain it 
few question on which attribute to select? we use information gain
slide 11
2- depends on type of attribute and gain if categorial number of tests=number of values, if numberic data we use someting like
slide 26

quesion last one in slide 11: if data in the sample belong to same class we stop the process and another way to stop it is the way the technique tree pruning used (optional) 

calculation the information gain and entropy, slide 19


Lesson 8: KNN simplet classification algo, how does it work? different measuremenets
and confusion matrix and tp fp tn fn and calculate accuracy sensitivity .....etc
different method for specifying accuracy
and how do we create ROC curve from scratch

ROC curve , we try to have higher tp rate and lower fp rate
(not in exam) the next 3 lines 
so from the graph as the fpr increases the tpr also increases
how much false p rate we need to get a good amount of true pos rate
f(x)=tpr-fpr   so it is a peak in the graph

but you need to know how to compare performance of two ROC curves slide 33 (example of very short answer questions :/ )
slide 34 is not in the exam creating roc in range slide 34


example of short answer question (last two labes given a dataset compute information gain...etc)


another example of questions can we use logistic regression model for classification? yes it propba is > 0.5 we can classify in yes class and if less we can classify in no classes slide 3

P( a1=medium | c=yes) =1/8  among yes classes what is the propb that a1=medium  (yes total=8 and medium total =1)
